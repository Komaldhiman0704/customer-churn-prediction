# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning (Telco Dataset)

---

## üìã Project Overview

This project implements a customer churn prediction system for a telecom company using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) based on their account details and usage patterns.

The key steps followed in this project are:
- Data loading and initial inspection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including visualization
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Addressing class imbalance with SMOTE oversampling
- Model building using tree-based classifiers: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation with cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used is the publicly available **Telco Customer Churn** dataset from Kaggle, containing 7,043 customer records with features like tenure, monthly charges, total charges, and churn status.

**Important notes about the dataset:**

- The `TotalCharges` column contains some missing values represented as spaces, replaced with 0.0, then converted to float.
- The target column `Churn` is imbalanced; addressed by SMOTE oversampling during training.
- Mix of categorical and numerical features are present.

## üöÄ How to Run

### Run in Google Colab (Recommended)

1. Open the notebook (`Customer_Churn_Telco.ipynb`) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Upload the Telco dataset CSV file or mount Google Drive containing it.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the full workflow ‚Äî from data analysis to model evaluation.

### Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/Komaldhiman0704/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction



2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate # Windows



3. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Open and run the notebook `Customer_Churn_Telco.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
